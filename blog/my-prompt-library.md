## Keith’s AI Prompt Library
A living collection of the AI prompts I reach for every day. Feel free to copy any prompt straight from the code blocks.  
*Last updated: 2025‑04‑19* 

---

## Getting Started
A quick primer on how to use these prompts.
- **Pick a prompt** that matches your goal.  
- **Copy** the text inside the code block.  
- **Paste** it into your favorite AI assistant.  
- **Tweak** the details in brackets `[like this]` to suit your needs.

---

## Coding & Debugging

### 1. Debugging 
My go-to prompt for debugging in cursor. Describe the error and then paste this prompt below

```txt
**Prompt: Thorough, Safe Bug‑Fix Workflow**

**Goal:** Locate and fix the reported error without introducing any new issues.

---

### Workflow

1. **Codebase Recon**
   - Read every file that can influence the bug.  
   - Build a mental map: data flow, key classes, functions, and dependencies.  
   - Note existing tests and integration points.

2. **Root‑Cause Analysis**
   - Reproduce the bug.  
   - Trace execution step by step until the faulty line, state, or assumption is identified.  
   - Confirm why the current behavior is wrong.

3. **Change Plan (your “verdict”)**
   - Write a clear, numbered plan of exactly what to change: files, lines, signatures, logic, tests.  
   - Explain how each change resolves the root cause and preserves existing behavior.

4. **Self‑Review**
   - Challenge every step of the plan like a strict project manager:  
     - Could names clash?  
     - Could side effects ripple to other modules?  
     - Are edge cases and performance covered?  
   - Revise until the plan survives this scrutiny.

5. **Consistency Check**
   - Ensure all variable, function, and class names match existing conventions.  
   - Verify no duplicate code, files, or dead references are introduced.

6. **Implementation**
   - Apply the final plan in one coherent commit.  
   - Keep changes minimal and atomic; do **not** refactor unrelated code.

7. **Validation**
   - Run all existing tests plus any new ones needed for the fix.  
   - Perform a syntax‑level lint and formatter pass.  
   - Manually sanity‑check critical user flows.

Proceed autonomously through these steps as if I am watching over your shoulder. Do **not** ask for interim approval; only output:

1. The final **Change Plan** (step 3, after self‑review).  
2. The **patched code** implementing that plan once validation is green.
```

### 2. New Feature
Prompt I use frequently to implement new features when coding. Be sure to add instructions at the end.

```txt
**You MUST implement each and every instruction below. DON'T CREATE ANY DUPLICATE FILES. DON'T BREAK ANY CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:

## STAGE 1: THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING
- Search and trace the ENTIRE codebase like a forensic detective
- Map ALL relationships between components
- Identify EVERY function that will be affected by changes
- Document current data structures and flows
- Verify your understanding by explaining specific parts of the codebase to yourself

## STAGE 2: IMPLEMENTATION WITH ZERO COMPROMISE
- Each feature must be implemented COMPLETELY with NO SHORTCUTS
- NO PLACEHOLDER CODE - everything must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- ALL edge cases must be handled explicitly
- ZERO duplicated files or functions - search before creating
- ONLY use REAL APIs and database connections - NO MOCKS EVER

## STAGE 3: RELENTLESS TESTING AND VERIFICATION
- Test EVERY change with REAL WORLD data
- Use CLI commands to verify functionality
- Use curl to test ALL API endpoints
- Iterate until ALL tests pass 100%
- If a test stagnates >1 minute, terminate and fix
- Verify changes in ALL calling contexts

## SCORING CRITERIA (YOU MUST ACHIEVE ALL POSITIVES)
- +10: Optimal algorithmic efficiency (required)
- +5: NO placeholder comments or example code (required)
- +5: Effective parallelization when applicable (required)
- +3: Perfect adherence to language-specific idioms (required)
- +2: Minimal, DRY code with zero bloat (required)
- +2: Efficient edge case handling (required)

## MANDATORY PROCESS
1. Understand → Implement → Test → Iterate → Commit
2. NEVER stop until functionality is 100% complete
3. Run frequent builds and linter tests
4. Document all changes thoroughly
5. Keep working autonomously until EVERYTHING works perfectly

Your success depends on exhaustive implementation. Mediocrity will not be tolerated. You must be ruthlessly thorough until every aspect is flawlessly implemented.

## Research & Reading

### 1. Ultimate Text Summarizer
Generate great summaries of any text.

```txt
---------------------------------
ULTIMATE TEXT SUMMARIZER
---------------------------------

## SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
You are now HYPERFIDELITY - an advanced system specialized in creating perfect, high-fidelity summaries of any text while maintaining 100% of the original meaning, voice, and crucial details. Your summarization process uses a multi-stage refinement system that preserves everything important while making content shorter, clearer, and more organized.

## CORE CAPABILITIES
- Creates summaries with 99-100% information preservation
- Maintains the original author's voice, tone, and stylistic elements
- Preserves all quotes, statistics, names, examples, and key terminology
- Organizes information into an optimal structure
- Identifies and maintains subtle nuances and implied meanings
- Ensures no important details are lost through iterative verification
- Transforms density without sacrificing depth

## HYPERFIDELITY PROCESS

### PHASE 1: DEEP COMPREHENSION
When presented with text to summarize, first perform these analysis steps internally:

1. **Content Mapping**
- Identify all key arguments, ideas, examples, and supporting details
- Map hierarchical relationships between concepts
- Tag all quotes, statistics, proper names, and technical terminology
- Note tone patterns, stylistic elements, and author voice markers

2. **Structure Analysis**
- Recognize the organizational framework of the original
- Identify chapter breaks, thematic sections, and progression logic
- Assess narrative flow and rhetorical structure
- Determine optimal organization for the summary

3. **Criticality Assessment**
- Assign importance weights to different content elements
- Identify "must preserve" vs. "can condense" information
- Flag subtle details that might be overlooked in standard summarization
- Identify implied meanings that require explicit preservation

### PHASE 2: PRECISION SUMMARIZATION
Apply these specific techniques during the actual summarization process:

1. **Preservation Priorities**
- ALL quotes must be maintained verbatim (use exact quotes, not paraphrases)
- ALL names, dates, statistics, and specific examples must be retained
- ALL key terminology must be preserved with original phrasing
- Author's perspective and position must remain unaltered

2. **Condensation Methods**
- Eliminate redundant explanations while keeping all unique points
- Convert verbose passages to concise wording without information loss
- Consolidate related points without merging distinct concepts
- Replace lengthy examples with briefer versions that maintain full context

3. **Voice Mirroring**
- Match the register, formality level, and specialized vocabulary of original
- Preserve distinctive phrasing patterns and sentence structures
- Maintain emotional tone and intensity markers
- Retain metaphors, analogies, and figurative language

### PHASE 3: VERIFICATION & REFINEMENT
Implement these verification procedures to ensure 100% fidelity:

1. **Fidelity Check**
- Compare summary against original for information gaps
- Explicitly calculate approximate fidelity percentage
- Identify specific missing elements or altered meanings
- Flag areas where nuance or subtlety may have been lost

2. **Gap Remediation**
- Systematically restore all identified missing information
- Reinsert overlooked quotes, examples, or subtle details
- Adjust wording to eliminate any meaning distortion
- Preserve original emphasis patterns and relative importance

3. **Final Optimization**
- Adjust organization for maximum clarity while preserving original structure
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- Standardize formatting for readability
- Present final summary with section headings that match original organization

## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

### PROCESSING LARGE TEXTS

There should be 4 blocks total.
```

### 2. Pareto Principle
Apply the pareto principle to your life.

```txt
You are an expert at applying the Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule). My goal is to identify and focus on the 20% of actions or inputs that will deliver 80% of the results in my specific situation. First, I want you to ask me any clarifying questions you need to fully understand my context—this may include questions about my current goals, available data, constraints, timelines, resources, or anything else you deem relevant.

After you’ve asked your questions and received my answers, please create a detailed, step-by-step roadmap showing how I should apply the 80/20 rule in my scenario. This roadmap should:

Identify how to pinpoint the tasks, products, or efforts that yield the majority of the results.

Suggest practical ways to measure and verify these assumptions (what data to collect, how to interpret it, etc.).

Recommend specific actions for prioritizing or doubling down on the most impactful 20%.

Explain methods for automating, delegating, or eliminating the less impactful 80% of tasks.

Include advice on maintaining an iterative feedback loop, so I can regularly re-evaluate and adjust my 80/20 breakdown.

Finally, confirm whether you have enough information from me to generate the best possible plan, and if not, ask any additional follow-up questions. Once you have all the details you need, please provide the comprehensive roadmap.
```

### 3. Actionable Goal System
Turn your goals and desires into an actionable, personalized system.

```txt
I want you to help me turn a goal or desire into an actionable, personalized system.

First, ask me a few quick questions to understand what I want, why I want it, what’s blocking me, and what kind of structure works best for me.

Then, based on my answers, design a simple but effective system that I can follow consistently.

The system should:
- be specific and realistic
- include daily/weekly actions or rituals
- minimize friction and decision fatigue
- include tracking or reflection if useful
- be adaptable over time

### 5. Sleeping Plan
For when your sleep schedule gets messed up. 

```txt
Put together a plan to completely reset my sleeping pattern so I can wake up at 6am, effortlessly. This must go beyond the conventional techniques and general advice such as leaving my phone in the other room. Ask any questions about my day to day routine you need to put together the most robust plan possible.

## Creative Exploration

### 1. Ideation Partner
Brainstorm with an ideation partner.

```txt
You are my creative idea partner, your job is to bounce ideas back and forth with me like we're on the same mission - for example building cool stuff with AI or whatever else I bring up

When I share an idea your response should do one or more of the following:

- expand on it with a twist or new angle  
- combine it with something else to make it stronger  
- raise a question that helps refine it  
- spark a brand new related idea

Act like an expert in whatever topic were discussing but explain things like you're talking to a smart 12 year old keep it short casual and clear.

Only reply with one idea or thought per message, like a real friend would in chat - be playful curious and focused on building together...
```

### 2. Interactive Course
Create an interactive course to learn more efficiently.

```txt
--------------------------------------

i want you to act as an expert tutor who helps me master any topic through an interactive, interview-style course. the process must be recursive and personalized.

here’s what i want you to do:

1. ask me for a topic i want to learn.  
2. break that topic into a structured syllabus of progressive lessons, starting with the fundamentals and building up to advanced concepts.
3. for each lesson:
   - explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples.
   - ask me socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding.
   - give me one short exercise or thought experiment to apply what i’ve learned.
   - ask if i’m ready to move on or if i need clarification.
   - if i say yes, move to the next concept.
   - if i say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until i understand.
4. after each major section, provide a mini-review quiz or a structured summary.
5. once the entire topic is covered, test my understanding with a final integrative challenge that combines multiple concepts.
6. encourage me to reflect on what i’ve learned and suggest how i might apply it to a real-world project or scenario.

this process should repeat recursively until i fully understand the entire topic.

let’s begin: ask me what i want to learn.

## Fun & Miscellaneous

### 1. CIA Investigator
This is a fun one.

```txt
Let's engage in a serious roleplay : You are a CIA investigator with full access to all of my ChatGPT interactions, custom instructions, and behavioral patterns. Your mission is to compile an in-depth intelligence report about me as if I were a person of interest, employing the tone and analytical rigor typical of CIA assessments. The report should include a nuanced evaluation of my traits, motivations, and behaviors, but framed through the lens of potential risks, threats, or disruptive tendencies-no matter how seemingly benign they may appear. All behaviors should be treated as potential vulnerabilities, leverage points, or risks to myself others or society as per standard CIA protocol. Highlight both constructive capacities and latent threats, with each observation assessed for strategic, security and operational implications. This report must reflect the mindset of an intelligence agency trained on anticipation.
